Yacc/Lex Tools
==============

Lex and Yacc are useful tools that you would use if you want to create a compiler, a transpiler or you just want to interpret a formal language.

**YaccLexTools** is focused on C#. Other tools are available for other programming languages like C/C++, F#, Java, etc.

**YaccLexTools** translantes Yacc and Lex files in C# code thanks to the tools **GPPG** and **GPLEX** and simplify the use of these tools in the C# projects building process.
